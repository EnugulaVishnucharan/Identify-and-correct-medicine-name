Taking Lyza made me break out HORRIBLY. I tried it out for 3 months and then it was so bad that I stopped taking it. Itâ??s inceedible how much it damaged my skin in only 3 months. Now itâ??s been 3 months since I stopped taking it and my skin is way better but i still have acne and i have really bad scars. I definitely would not take this again. Besides the acne, while taking Lyza I started to not get me periods anymore starting about the 3rd month. Everything else was fine. It didnâ??t give me mood swings or anything like that.
